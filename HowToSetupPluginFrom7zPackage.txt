How to install plugin:

1) Put "Control Plugin.dll" 
    for AIMP 3.6+: to AIMP player's "Plugins\Control Plugin" directory.
    for AIMP 3.5 and older: to AIMP player's "Plugins" directory.
2) Put 'htdocs' directory to path which is writeable for AIMP. Do not put it to Program Files dir.
    This is required for album cover support. If you don't need it put it to any folder.
3) Optional: put SettingsManager directory near to "Control Plugin.dll".
    Launch it to tune all aspects of plugin work. It will save settings.dat file.
4) Skip if you use SettingManager.
    Create plugin settings.dat file.
        There are several ways to do this:
            4.1) Just launch AIMP and exit, plugin will save default settings file in plugin folder("Control Plugin") in AIMP Plugins directory.
                 "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin\settings.dat"
            4.2) Copy settings.dat from 7z package to "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin" directory.

    In settings.dat set following values:
        httpserver.document_root - set full path to htdocs directory.
        httpserver.interfaces - set list of network interfaces where plugin server will work.
        To use all available interfaces uncomment element:
            <all_interfaces port="3333" />
        
5) Optional, album cover support 
    Copy following files to "<installed AIMP path>\Plugins\Control Plugin" directory:
        FreeImage.dll
        FreeImagePlus.dll
        
Test plugin work:
    Open plugin's page in browser. Default URL is http://localhost:3333/index.htm.
